## 📝 Project Overview

EmotionalAdvisorBot is an intelligent, rule-based emotional advisory chatbot designed for the Telegram platform as part of an AI course project.  
The main goal of this bot is to provide **empathetic, human-centered conversations** by detecting users’ emotional states through text and responding with appropriate guidance, practical coping strategies, and personalized book recommendations.

Unlike simple chatbots that offer generic motivational phrases, this project emphasizes **emotional understanding, contextual awareness, and psychologically safe interaction**.

## 💡 Motivation and Purpose

Many chatbots respond superficially to user emotions, failing to recognize the true emotional experience. EmotionalAdvisorBot addresses this by:

- 🧠 Identifying emotional cues from textual input  
- ❤️ Responding with empathy instead of judgment  
- 🛠️ Providing practical, actionable strategies for each emotional state  
- 📖 Suggesting relevant books to encourage self-reflection and emotional growth

The goal is to create a chatbot that feels **supportive, respectful, and emotionally intelligent**, even without advanced AI models.

- 😰 Stress  
- 😨 Anxiety  
- 😢 Sadness and low mood  
- 😃 Positive mood and motivation  
- 😡 Anger  
- 😱 Fear  
- 😵 Panic  
- 🟠 Jealousy  
- 🔴 Shame  
- 🟣 Embarrassment

## ⚙️ How the Bot Works

1. 📤 The user sends a text message to the bot.  
2. 🔍 The bot analyzes the message using rule-based keyword detection.  
3. 🎯 The user’s emotional state is identified.  
4. 💌 The bot sends a **single, comprehensive response** including emotional validation, guidance, and practical tips.  
5. 📖 A **separate message** provides relevant book recommendations for further reading.

This design ensures **clarity, readability, and a natural conversational flow**.
